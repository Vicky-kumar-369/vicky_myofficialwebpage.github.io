            <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
            <p> In our daily life computer has became a part, nowadays many companies that can be smaller or bigger are using websites in their businesses. Have you ever thought how these websites are made? These websites are made using three language that
                are <strong>HTML
                CSS and Javascript</strong> . Let us take a example of a car . In car it's body is made up of iron which has given a structure to the car. And hammers or machines are used to give it a better shapes and design that make it attractive.
                And last but not least is it's engine that help the car to do its work and run on given command by a human. Here we can say that iron used in car is HTML , hammer is CSS that gives it good designs and last it's engine is javascript which
                make webpages interactive with humans.Further we will learn to these language in detail . <br> In this course we will use <strong>VS Code</strong> code editor you can download and install it from <a href="" style="text-decoration:none;font-family:cursive;">Here </a > or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=download+vscode" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;font-family:cursive;" >Search</a>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup language) as name suggests it is a markup language used to give structure to web pages. Many people thinks that HTML is a programming language but that's not true, it is a markup language that means we can only give structure to
                our website i.e. we can enter the texts, check box, tables, text areas , in our website by using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some important terms and points of HTML that we will use further: <br>
                <ul id="unorderedlist" type="disc">
                    <li>In HTML, there is opening tags (
                        <&nbsp;>) and closing tags (
                            <&nbsp;/&nbsp;>) </li>
                    <li> Tags : It have some attributes or abilities. <br> Eg.
                        < input>,
                            < table>, etc
                    </li>
                    <li> Element : Tags and content inside it, is together called Element <br> Eg. &lt;p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. &lt;/p> </li>

                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <q>
 Don't worry if unable to understand you will learn it after spending some times in it. I was also unable to understand when i was started this.
